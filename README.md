# North GL

This is an experiment using [Regl](regl.party) and Typescript to build a basic model loader.
Current goals:

 - [x] Load an arbitrary OBJ model into the scene
 - [x] Implement basic directional lighting
 - [ ] Build a UI to allow modification of an objects properties (material etc) at runtime
 - [ ] Apply translations to objects in the scene
 - [ ] Make objects in the scene clickable
 - [ ] Make objects in the scene draggable
 - [ ] Add support in the shaders for image textures
